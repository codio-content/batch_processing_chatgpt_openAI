In this exercise, you'll be developing a function, `GenerateBatch`, that leverages the batch processing capabilities of the OpenAI's GPT API. Your function will take a list of prompts from the user, process them in one batch request to the OpenAI API, and return the generated responses. This exercise is designed to familiarize you with the idea of batch processing in the context of AI models.

Here's the function signature:

```python

def GenerateBatch(prompts: list) -> list:
    pass
```
Your function should meet the following requirements:

- Accept a list of prompts as input.
- Make a single call to the OpenAI API with the batch of prompts.
- Return a list of responses. Each response should be a tuple containing the generated text and the finish reason for each prompt.


You would use this function as follows:

```python
print( GenerateBatch(["what is pluto", "how big is sun"])

```
